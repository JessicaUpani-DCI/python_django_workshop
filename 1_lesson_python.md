# Python - 01

**Objectives (Python):**
- Variables
- Data types
- If statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Classes


## Variables
Variables are place holders for values stored in the computer.

```python
#Write a program that adds two numbers and return the result.
# Your program should additionally also perform the multiplication sign on the same numbers and return the result.

# 4 + 12
# 4 * 12


```
## Data types
This represent the types of data that values can take up.

- Numeric: int, float
- Alphabetic: str
- Boolearn: True, False
- DateTime


## If statements
If statements are used to make decisions in the program.

There are 3 types of if staements:
- if ...
- if ... else
- if ... elif


## Loops
Loops are used to repeat instructions.

There are two types of loops:
- for loops
    - can be used when you know how many times you are repeating.
- while loops
    - more useful for cases when you do not know how many times you are repeating.


## Functions
Functions are Python objects that are used to reuse a piece of code.

- def keyword is used to define a function.
- a return statement can be used to return a result of the function.
- a call has to be made in order for the function to be executed.
- every fuction is preceded by parenthesis.

def func():
    result = <instructions>
    return result
